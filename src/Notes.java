public class Notes {
    // class extends class
    // class implements interface
    // interface extends interface

    // whenever we call the object the default constructor of the parent obj is called
    // -------->>Inheritance - drawing the features from the parent classes

    //-------->> polymorphism - poly - many , morphism - forms a single thing can be written in many forms
    // 1.method overloading- compile time
    //  void fun(int a)
    // void fun(int a,int b)

    // 2. method overriding- run time
    // Animal a = new Elephant() - it is possible
    // Elephane e = new Animal() -  it is not possible
    //variables bind at compile time and methods bind at runtime

    //-------->> Encapsulation - binding data and methods to achieve data hiding
        // priviata - within same class
        // Default - within package
        // protected - same package and also int the child class
        // public - anywhere


    //---------> Abstraction -It is used to hide the unnecessary information or data from the user but
    // shows the essential data that is useful for the user.
    // can be achieved using
    // 1. Interface(100 %)--  implementation is done in the child class
    // 2. Abstract classes(partial)-- implementation is done in the child class as well as int that class
